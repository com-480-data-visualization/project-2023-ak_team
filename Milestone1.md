## 1.1 Overview

  Films from various cultural backgrounds are available to audiences worldwide, enriching the cinematic landscape with diverse stories and perspectives. 

Movies serve not only as a form of entertainment but also as a medium to connect people, ignite conversations, and allow us to experience emotions and adventures beyond our own realities. The ever-evolving nature of the film industry will continue to grow and diversify. As the film industry continues to expand, the sheer volume of movies and actors involved can make it challenging to fully comprehend the scope and diversity of the cinematic universe. This democratization of film production means that there is a constant stream of new movies and actors to discover, further adding to the difficulty of grasping the full picture of the cinematic landscape. 

## 1.2 Motivation & goal :

  We are both passionate about cinema and films have been part of our daily lives since we were very young. 

But for someone who is not a real movie lover it can be difficult to find himself in the immense diversity of films, genres or actors and to visualize the great perplexity of the relationships between actors and directors.

 Have you ever wondered in which movies this actors have played ? Or in which movies have a famous duo of actors participating in ? Wouldnâ€™t be awesome to get the full picture of the entire list of person an actor played with in its career and to be able to retrieve all the information about the films they played in ? Who hasn't spent an hour of their evening trying to find a suitable movie because they couldn't see the whole landscape of options?

That's why we had the idea to create an interactive graph that showcases the relationships between actors and directors based on the movies they worked on together. The graph will allow anyone to explore in an interactive and intuitive way through time and genres, the connections in the movie industry and gain insight into the movies and the peoples that collaborated on it. The visualization will includes multiple interactive buttons, such as a date cursor that enables users to filter the graph based on the movies release date. Similarly, the possibility for the user to select a particular genre to directly filter the corresponding movies. 
We would like to display all these informations into 3 distinct graphs that the user could switch in between:

  - An actor-to-actor network: When you search for an actor, this network displays all the fellow actors they have shared the screen with.
  - An actor-to-director network: When you search for an actor, this network reveals all the directors they have collaborated with.
  - A director-to-actor network: When you search for a director, this network showcases all the actors they have worked with.


## 1.3 Target audience:

This project is for anyone who is remotely interested in the film industry. Whether it's an experienced film buff looking to expand their knowledge of the industry or just someone wondering what movie to watch tonight, the vast amount of easily accessible information is intended to be accessible to anyone.


# 2 Dataset

Our two main datasets [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) and [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) were originally created as part of a study titled "Movie Genre Classification based on Poster Images with Deep Neural Networks". This study aimed to explore the possibility of classifying movie genres using movie poster images and deep learning techniques. The researchers compiled an extensive collection of movie information and poster images spanning from 1980 to 2015 to serve as the foundation for their analysis.

The [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie information spanning from 1980 to 2015. Each year has its own text file containing movie data in JSON format. 
The dataset includes a wide range of information about each movie, such as:

  - _id: A unique identifier for each movie entry in the dataset, typically an ObjectId generated by MongoDB.
  - imdbID: The IMDb identifier for the movie, a unique alphanumeric string (e.g., "tt0120915") that allows you to access the movie's IMDb page.
  - Rated: The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating for the movie, which indicates the suitable audience age group (e.g., "PG", "PG-13", "R").
  - Runtime: The duration of the movie in minutes (e.g., "136 min").
  - imdbVotes: The total number of IMDb user votes for the movie (e.g., "513,986").
  - Response: A boolean value indicating whether the movie information was successfully retrieved ("True" or "False").
  - Type: The type of the entry, usually "movie" for films.
  - Country: The primary country where the movie was produced (e.g., "USA").
  - Genre: A list of genres associated with the movie, separated by commas (e.g., "Action, Adventure, Fantasy").
  - Awards: A description of the awards and nominations the movie has received (e.g., "Nominated for 3 Oscars. Another 17 wins & 60 nominations.").
  - Box_office: The total box office revenue for the movie in US dollars (e.g., "474,544,677").
  - Writer: The main writer or writers responsible for the movie's screenplay (e.g., "George Lucas").
  - Title: The full title of the movie (e.g., "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace").
  - Metascore: The movie's Metascore, an aggregated rating from professional critics, ranging from 0 to 100 (e.g., "51").
  - Actors: A list of the movie's main actors, separated by commas (e.g., "Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd").
  - imdbRating: The average IMDb user rating for the movie, ranging from 0 to 10 (e.g., "6.5").
  - Released: The release date of the movie (e.g., "19 May 1999").
  - Director: The director of the movie (e.g., "George Lucas").
  - Language: The primary language spoken in the movie (e.g., "English").

Complementing the movie_data_per_year dataset is the [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) dataset. This dataset is organized into directories for each year from 1980 to 2015 and contains JPEG images of movie posters corresponding to the movies listed in the movie_data_per_year dataset. The connection between the movie_data_per_year and movie_poster_per_year datasets is established through the IMDb IDs of the movies. Each poster image is named after the IMDb ID of the corresponding movie. For example, the poster for the movie "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" has the file name "tt0120915.jpg" because its IMDb ID is tt0120915. 

These images can be used to provide a visual representation of each movies. By combining both datasets, users can access a rich source of movie-related information that can be employed in a wide range of analyses and projects.

# 3 Data Extraction

Before the preprocessing of our data we needed to [extract and transform into a clean dataframe](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/data_extraction.ipynb) the bulk data that we found. The movie_data_per_year dataset posed several challenges, primarily due to the varying availability of information for each movie. Some movies lacked certain fields, such as Metascore or Box_office, particularly for less famous films. This inconsistency made it difficult to create a unified and clean DataFrame for further analysis. To address this issue, we thoroughly examined the format of each movie entry and assigned NaN values to the missing fields. This approach allowed us to maintain a consistent structure while acknowledging the absence of specific data points.

Another challenge during the preprocessing phase was to link the movie posters from the movie_poster_per_year dataset to the corresponding movies in the movie_data_per_year dataset. Matching the posters to the movies based on the poster name was not a straightforward task, as the naming conventions for the poster files might not always align with the movie titles or IMDb IDs.

To overcome this difficulty, we implemented the following steps:

  - First, we created a dictionary or mapping to associate the movie poster file names with their respective IMDb IDs. This mapping could be generated using either the movie title or other unique identifiers available in the dataset.

  - Next, we iterated through each movie entry in the movie_data_per_year dataset and used the mapping created in the previous step to identify the corresponding poster file name.

  - We then added a new column to the DataFrame, which stored the associated poster file names for each movie. This new column enabled us to maintain a direct relationship between the movies and their corresponding posters.

By following these steps, we were able to successfully attribute each movie poster from the movie_poster_per_year dataset to the appropriate movie in the movie_data_per_year dataset. This preprocessing enabled us to create a complete and structured DataFrame, which served as the foundation for subsequent data analysis and visualization tasks.

# 4 Data Pre-Processing

In our [preprocessing part](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/data_processing.ipynb), we carried out an extensive preprocessing process on the movie dataset to make it suitable for further analysis. The following steps were taken:

  - We first selected the relevant columns: Title, Actors, Genre, Director, Writer, Poster, Language, Box_office, Country, Rated, Released, Runtime, imdbRating, and Awards.

  - To make the data more accessible for analysis, we converted the Actors and Directors columns into lists, separating individual names.

  - We dropped rows with missing values in the essential columns: Actors, Genre, and Poster. This decision ensured that the remaining data was complete and more reliable.

  - We identified unique actors and directors in the dataset and assigned them unique IDs. This process allowed us to create new columns 'Actors_id' and 'Director_id', which stored the IDs for each movie's actors and directors.

  - We constructed an actor-to-actor matrix and a director-to-actor matrix to represent the relationships between these entities. These matrices will be used to identify collaborative patterns in the dataset.

  - We provided functions to display movie posters based on the movie title and find movies with the most significant intersection of actors. These functions made the dataset more interactive and user-friendly.

  - We analyzed the dataset to determine the actors and directors who worked with the most actors and on the most movies. This information was valuable in identifying influential individuals in the industry.

  - Using the insights gained from the previous step, we filtered the dataset to include only movies with famous actors, a substantial box office, or a director from the list of most influential directors. This filtered dataset contained movies that were more likely to be of interest in further analyses.

These preprocessing steps have transformed the raw movie dataset into a more structured and valuable resource for further analysis and insights. The resulting dataset is now ready for use in various machine learning and data analysis tasks, enabling deeper exploration of relationships and patterns within the movie industry.


# 5 Related work

During our research, these are some of the works we came accross that inspired us.

* [An Interactive Visualization of Careers of Actors and Directors](http://khreda.com/vis/movienight/): This project explore the careers of various actors and directors in an interactive way. The interaction with the user interface is very interesting and close of what we had in mind even tho we would like to feature more possibilities. 

* [The Network Data Repository with Interactive Graph Analytics and Visualization](https://networkrepository.com/actor-movie.php): This site renders a bipartite network of movies and the actors that have played in them. It gave us a grasp about the complexity of showing to much information in a single graph and helped us reconsider what we really wanted to show. The user interaction with the graph is similar with what we wanted to implement for our project but again we would like to add more feature to help reduce the information displayed at once. 


* [Network Graphs of Actors Based on Popular Movies in Common](https://networkrepository.com/actor-movie.php](https://medium.com/web-mining-is688-spring-2021/network-graphs-of-actors-based-on-popular-movies-in-common-69d30e7b5e07): This paper was very useful for the preprocessing part of our data as it explore a problematic very close of what we had in mind. It also helped us reconsider the way we would center our graph around a single entity to obtain an more comprehensive vizualization tool
